# Chess Engine
This project is based on artificial intelligence. It is a bot which plays chess against you or
any other bot when you link it to a GUI such as arena which follows UCI protocols. It has a basic evaluation function to go to certain depths in the game and find the best move with the help of alphabeta search function. It also uses the iterative deepening method to find the best move so the depth of search will be slightly better on a fast system.
